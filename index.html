                    <p>
                        From learning programing throughout LaunchCode and classes through my university I have enjoyed it alot.
                        I would like to keep learning the materials that is necessary to apply for an apprenticeship and find a job that is 
                        related to what I enjoy the most from LaunchCode. I hope this will help me get my foot in the door at a company.
